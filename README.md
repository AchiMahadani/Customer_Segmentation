# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This repository presents a project focused on **Customer Segmentation**, which aims to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information. Customer segmentation is a crucial step for businesses to better understand their target audience and improve marketing strategies. By grouping customers into different segments, businesses can tailor their services and products to specific customer needs.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into distinct groups that share similar characteristics. In this project, we use unsupervised learning techniques such as **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on various features, such as age, income, spending habits, and more. 

This segmentation allows businesses to:
- Identify high-value customer groups.
- Customize marketing strategies to target specific segments.
- Improve customer retention by understanding segment-specific needs.

### Key Features:
- **K-Means Clustering**: The algorithm is used to group customers into clusters based on their characteristics.
- **Elbow Method**: Helps determine the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data.
- **Visualization**: The project includes visualizations such as cluster plots, distribution plots, and heatmaps to interpret the customer segments better.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of customer data that includes demographic information and purchasing behavior. Typical features in the dataset include:

- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Annual Income**: The annual income of the customer.
- **Spending Score**: A score that reflects the customerâ€™s spending behavior.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer.

These features are used to cluster customers into meaningful groups that represent different behavioral patterns and spending habits.

### Preprocessing Steps:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data is handled through imputation or removal, ensuring that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
- **Feature Scaling**: Since clustering algorithms are distance-based, features are normalized to ensure that no feature dominates the others.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is used to reduce the dimensions of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible, making it easier to visualize and interpret clusters.

## Clustering Approach

The core of the segmentation process relies on **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The steps involved in the clustering process include:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset and its features through summary statistics and visualizations.
2. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features for clustering, such as age, income, and spending score.
3. **Optimal Clusters**: Using the **Elbow Method** to identify the optimal number of clusters based on the sum of squared distances within clusters.
4. **Applying K-Means**: Clustering customers into groups and analyzing the characteristics of each cluster.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizing the clusters in two or three dimensions to interpret customer behavior patterns.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is applied to the dataset to reduce its dimensions and enable easier visualization. Although the original dataset may have several features, PCA reduces the complexity while preserving the variance, making it easier to plot the clusters.

## Conclusion

This customer segmentation project provides a systematic approach to grouping customers using K-Means Clustering. The project enables businesses to gain deeper insights into customer behavior, allowing them to develop targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase revenue.
